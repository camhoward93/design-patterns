# Design Patterns
The design patterns shown in this repository are either assignments from my Design Patterns course at the University of Nevada-Reno or examples from the Head First Design Patterns book that I have coded to help learn the pattern.

Each directory will be named after the corresponding design pattern and will have its own readme doc demonstrating an understanding of the design pattern as well as instructions on how to run the code.

## Importance
The importance of these design patterns is that they implement the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in order to solve recurring problems in programming.

## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation implements the level of abstraction by including within a program object all the necessary resources for it to function (method and data). Other objects can use the encapsulated object without knowing the inner workings of it.

Benefits: maintainability, flexibility, and extensibility.
### Inheritance
Inheritance is the concept that when a class is defined, a subclass can be defined and inherit the definitions of one or more general classes. For example, a subclass of Cat can inherit the properties and methods of a general class Mammal.

Benefits: maintenance and reliability. 
### Polymorphism
Polymorphism means "having multiple forms". It is the ability to assign different meaning to a single operator/symbol in different contexts. Such as overriding parameters or methods, or assigning a superclass variable to one subclass object type, then reassigning it to another.

Benefits: maintenance and variability.

### Cohesion
Cohesion is the degree to which the elements inside a module belong together. High cohesion means that the elements are related in a high degree and should be in the same module.

Benefits: readability, reusability, reduced complexity.
### Coupling
Coupling is the degree of interdependency between modules. If two modules are said to be tightly coupled, then they are very interdependent upon one another. Loose coupling is more desirable because tightly coupled modules must change together (even if the programmer only wants to change one).

Benefits: replaceability, testability, extendability.
